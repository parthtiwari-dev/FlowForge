# Workflow Engine

## Overview
The Workflow Engine is a robust framework designed to facilitate the creation, management, and execution of workflows. It provides a set of abstractions and utilities that allow users to define complex workflows in a declarative manner, manage task execution, and handle dependencies efficiently.

## Architecture
The project is structured into several core components:

- **Core**: Contains the main abstractions for tasks, DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs), scheduling, and execution.
- **DSL**: Provides a domain-specific language for defining workflows in a user-friendly manner.
- **Utils**: Includes various utility functions for logging, retry mechanisms, and metrics tracking.
- **State**: Manages state persistence for workflows, allowing for checkpointing and resuming.
- **Tests**: Contains unit tests for ensuring the reliability and correctness of the components.
- **Examples**: Provides sample workflows to demonstrate the capabilities of the engine.

## Usage Instructions
1. Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
2. Define your workflow using the DSL provided in `dsl/workflow_dsl.py`.
3. Execute your workflow using the CLI entry point in `cli.py`.
4. Monitor execution and logs through the logging utilities in `utils/logging_utils.py`.
