Purpose:
    Defines the Scheduler for the workflow orchestration engine. The Scheduler is responsible for
    coordinating the execution of tasks within a DAG, ensuring that each task runs only after its
    dependencies are satisfied. It manages task states, triggers execution, handles retries, 
    and optionally supports concurrency (threads/processes).

Key Responsibilities:
    - Accept a DAG of registered Task instances for scheduling.
    - Identify and dispatch tasks that are ready to run (all dependencies successful).
    - Monitor state transitions for each task (e.g., RUNNING, SUCCESS, FAILED).
    - Implement retry logic for failed tasks respecting their max_retries setting.
    - Optionally enable concurrent execution of eligible tasks.
    - Track overall workflow progress, providing status updates and completion detection.
    - Integrate with logging, event, and metric systems for observability.

Design & Methods to Implement:
    1. Scheduler class with:
        - __init__ accepting a DAG instance and optional concurrency settings.
        - run(): Main orchestration loop/scheduler logic.
        - _execute_task(task): Runs a task, updates state, handles errors/retries.
        - Optionally: concurrency helpers (threading/multiprocessing).
        - Progress reporting/logging integration.
    2. Internal attributes for:
        - DAG reference.
        - List or set of completed/failed tasks.
        - Task execution queue or pool.
        - Optional hooks/callbacks for events or metrics.

Usage:
    The Scheduler is the central engine module for executing workflows.
    It is invoked after a DAG is constructed, and manages the end-to-end execution flow,
    error/retry handling, and reporting until all tasks are completed or workflow fails.

Follow this design to implement robust scheduling and execution coordination for your workflow engine.
