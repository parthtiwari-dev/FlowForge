executor.py

Purpose:
    Provides executor classes for running workflow tasks. Executors are responsible for 
    abstracting how tasks are executedâ€”either sequentially, concurrently (with threads or processes), 
    or, in advanced versions, on remote/external systems.

Key Responsibilities:
    - Define a standard interface (BaseExecutor) for executing tasks.
    - Implement various executor types:
        - LocalExecutor: Runs tasks in the main process, sequentially.
        - ThreadedExecutor: Executes multiple tasks in parallel using threads.
        - MultiprocessExecutor: Runs tasks concurrently in separate processes for isolation/scalability.
        - (Optional/stretch) RemoteExecutor: Simulate or implement remote/distributed execution.
    - Manage task execution, result capture, and error propagation.
    - Integrate with the Scheduler to coordinate task dispatch using selected executor type.
    - Optionally handle resource allocation and cleanup for each execution context.

Design & Methods to Implement:
    1. BaseExecutor class with an abstract execute(task) method.
    2. LocalExecutor subclass for simple in-process execution.
    3. ThreadedExecutor/MultiprocessExecutor subclasses for parallelism, using Python's concurrent.futures.
    4. Optionally: methods for initialization/shutdown, status monitoring, and resource management.

Usage:
    The Scheduler will instantiate the appropriate Executor and delegate all task runs to it.
    Executors can be swapped to change execution mode (sequential or concurrent), 
    supporting scalability, extensibility, and testing.

Follow this design to implement a flexible, robust task execution layer for your workflow engine.
